### **A Declaration of Interdependence for the Peoples of Earth**

When, in the course of human development, it becomes self-evident that the fates of all peoples and the health of the planet are inextricably linked; when the threads of technology, ecology, and economy have woven us into a single global tapestry, a decent respect for the reality of our shared existence requires that we declare the principles of our interconnection.

We have long celebrated independenceâ€”the noble pursuit of individual liberty and national sovereignty. But to survive and flourish in this modern age, we must now declare not our independence from one another, but our profound and inescapable interdependence.

We therefore recognize and affirm these fundamental truths:

#### **I. An Interdependence of Minds**

No thought is an island. Our knowledge is a shared inheritance, built upon the discoveries and artistry of countless generations. We recognize that freedom of expression is lifeless without the freedom to listen, and the right to inquire is hollow without a commons of knowledge to explore. We therefore have a collective duty to protect the channels of communication, to foster intellectual curiosity, and to defend the right of others to express truths that challenge our own, for in the free exchange of ideas, all of humanity is elevated.

#### **II. An Interdependence of Dignity**

The security of my rights is contingent upon the defense of yours. A society that tolerates the violation of one person's autonomy, privacy, or identity puts the dignity of all at risk. In a digital world where data connects us all, a breach of one is a vulnerability for all. We therefore have a collective duty to build legal, social, and technological systems that honor the sovereignty of every individual, recognizing that our personal freedom is fortified only when it is universally upheld.

#### **III. An Interdependence of Survival**

Our planet is not an inheritance to be exploited, but a single, shared home to be tended. The air we breathe, the water we drink, and the climate that sustains us know no borders. The pollution of one nation becomes the poison of another; the preservation of one ecosystem provides resilience for all. We therefore have a collective and generational duty to act as stewards of Earth, recognizing that our responsibility extends to our ancestors, to each other, and to all generations yet to come. The right to a healthy planet is a duty we owe to everyone, everywhere, forever.

#### **IV. An Interdependence of Prosperity**

A life of dignity cannot be lived in isolation. The presence of poverty, disease, or ignorance anywhere is a threat to stability and prosperity everywhere. The chain of humanity is only as strong as its most vulnerable link. We recognize that my well-being is not diminished but enhanced by ensuring your access to healthcare, education, and shelter. We therefore have a collective duty to build systems of care and opportunity, understanding that the security of the most vulnerable among us is the true measure of the security of all.

#### **V. An Interdependence of Justice**

Justice that is not universal is not justice. The arc of the moral universe can only bend toward justice if we pull it together. When a person anywhere faces persecution, a wall that keeps them out ultimately cages us within. Sanctuary is not an act of charity, but a recognition of our shared humanity in the face of suffering. We therefore have a collective duty to uphold the rule of law, to offer refuge to the displaced, and to dismantle systems of oppression, for an injustice against one is a wound inflicted upon the conscience of all.

#### **VI. An Interdependence of Power**

Power, whether governmental, corporate, or algorithmic, must be accountable to the people it affects. In a networked world, unaccountable power in one domain can disrupt the lives of millions in another. We recognize that the concentration of authority without oversight is a threat to the global equilibrium of rights. We therefore have a collective duty to demand transparency, champion decentralized authority, and ensure that all systems of power remain servants to humanity, not its masters.

### **Our Mutual Pledge**

We, therefore, the inhabitants of Earth, appealing to the better angels of our nature and the evidence of our shared reality, do solemnly publish and declare our Interdependence. We affirm that these collective duties are not burdens to be endured, but opportunities to build a more just, resilient, and flourishing world.

And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the strength of our shared humanity, we mutually pledge to each other our **Reason**, our **Compassion**, and our sacred **Honor**.
