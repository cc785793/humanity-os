### **Preamble**

We, the people of Earth, recognizing our shared destiny on a single, fragile planet, and understanding that our technologies, economies, and ecosystems are deeply interconnected, hereby declare a new charter of fundamental rights. This document is not intended to replace local laws or cultural traditions, but to establish a universal foundation of dignity, justice, and well-being to which all individuals are entitled, and which all institutions—governmental, corporate, or otherwise—are obligated to protect.

### **Guiding Principles**

This Global Bill of Rights is founded on several key shifts from its 18th-century predecessor:

- **From National to Universal:** These rights apply to every human being, regardless of nationality, location, or status.
- **From Negative to Positive Rights:** It includes not only freedoms *from* oppression (negative rights) but also entitlements *to* the basic necessities of a dignified life (positive rights).
- **From Analog to Digital:** It explicitly addresses the realities of the digital age, including data, artificial intelligence, and global connectivity.
- **From Individual to Interconnected:** It acknowledges that individual rights are meaningless without a healthy planet and a just society.

### **The Ten Articles of Global Rights**

#### **Article I: The Right to Freedom of Conscience, Expression, and Inquiry**

Every person has the right to their own thoughts, beliefs, and conscience, whether religious, spiritual, or secular. This includes the freedom to express ideas, opinions, and creativity in any medium, digital or physical, without fear of censorship or retribution. This right is paired with the responsibility to not incite violence or engage in targeted harassment. The pursuit of knowledge, art, and science is a fundamental human activity and shall be protected.

#### **Article II: The Right to Bodily and Mental Autonomy**

Every person possesses absolute authority over their own physical and mental being. This includes the right to make informed decisions about their own healthcare, reproduction, and end-of-life choices. It guarantees freedom from non-consensual medical or scientific experimentation. Furthermore, it protects an individual's cognitive liberty—the right to a mind free from coercive manipulation, whether through propaganda, neuro-technology, or algorithmic influence.

#### **Article III: The Right to Digital Privacy and Data Sovereignty**

Every person has the right to be secure from unwarranted surveillance, whether by public or private entities. All personal data is considered an extension of the self; individuals have the right to own, control, access, and erase their personal data. All algorithmic systems used in public decision-making must be transparent, auditable, and free from unjust bias. Encryption is a right, not a crime.

#### **Article IV: The Right to a Healthy and Sustainable Planet**

Every person has the right to a clean, safe, and ecologically balanced environment. This includes the right to clean air and water, healthy soil, a stable climate, and thriving biodiversity. This right places a shared responsibility on all generations to act as stewards of the planet, ensuring its health and resilience for the future of all life.

#### **Article V: The Right to Fair and Just Recourse**

When accused of wrongdoing, every person is entitled to a fair and impartial hearing. They have the right to a presumption of innocence, legal representation, and a trial free from undue delay. Torture, cruel, inhuman, or degrading punishment is unequivocally prohibited. Justice systems must be focused on rehabilitation and restoration, not merely retribution.

#### **Article VI: The Right to Essential Well-being**

A life of dignity is impossible without basic security. Therefore, every person has the right to quality healthcare, nutritious food, clean water, adequate housing, and lifelong access to education. These are not commodities but fundamental utilities for human flourishing, and societies have a collective obligation to ensure their availability.

#### **Article VII: The Right to Equitable Opportunity and Identity**

Every person has the right to be treated as an equal, without discrimination based on race, ethnicity, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, disability, genetic makeup, religion, or place of birth. All people shall have fair access to participate in the economic, cultural, and civic life of their communities. Identity is a personal journey, and no one shall be forced into a state-defined or socially-enforced category.

#### **Article VIII: The Right to Free Movement and Sanctuary**

Recognizing our shared humanity on one planet, every person has the right to move freely, both within their own country and across borders. When facing persecution, war, or climate-induced catastrophe, every person has the right to seek and receive sanctuary and to be treated with dignity as a refugee, not as an illegal alien.

#### **Article IX: The Right to Access and Contribute to Knowledge**

Human progress is built on shared knowledge. Every person has the right to access the internet as a neutral and open platform, as well as the accumulated scientific, cultural, and historical knowledge of humanity. Furthermore, they have the right to contribute to this commons of knowledge, and the fruits of publicly funded research should be made freely available to all.

#### **Article X: The Unenumerated Rights and the Sovereignty of the Person**

The enumeration of these rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people. The fundamental unit of moral and legal concern is the individual human being, not the state, the corporation, or the algorithm. Power should be decentralized to the lowest effective level, and the ultimate source of all just authority resides with the people.
