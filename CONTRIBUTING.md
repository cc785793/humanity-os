### The Review Process: A Community-Led Conversation

This project is in its infancy and is fueled by volunteer spirit. We believe in transparency, and this is our transparent truth: **there is not yet a dedicated team of active maintainers who can promise immediate feedback.**

This presents a unique opportunity to truly live the principles we espouse.

Instead of a traditional, top-down review process, we will rely on the "Interdependence of Minds." In this project, **the community is the primary maintainer.** Your proposals for change will not be judged from on high; they will be discussed, refined, and approved by your peersâ€”other people who care enough to show up.

Here is how we will coordinate this together.

#### Your Role as a Contributor

When you open a Pull Request (PR), you are not just submitting a change; you are starting a public conversation and taking on the role of its initial steward.

1. **Make a Clear Case:** In your PR description, explain the 'why' behind your change as clearly as possible. This is your opening argument.
2. **Be Your Own First Critic:** Re-read your changes. Does it align with the project's principles? Is it easy to understand? Anticipate questions others might have.
3. **Engage with Feedback:** Be prepared to discuss, defend, and even change your proposal based on community feedback. Your willingness to collaborate is as important as the original idea.
4. **Call for Reviewers:** Don't wait for people to find your PR. Share a link in the [Discussions tab](https://github.com/cc785793/humanity-os/discussions) or with other people you know who might be interested, and invite them to review your work.

#### Your Role as a Community Reviewer (Everyone is a Reviewer)

You do not need permission to review a pull request. If you are reading this, you are qualified to help.

1. **Browse Open Pull Requests:** Look for proposals that interest you or where you feel you have a valuable perspective.
2. **Offer Feedback Based on Our Pledge:** Review the proposed changes through the lens of **Reason, Compassion, and Honor.**
    - **Reason:** Does the change make logical sense? Does it improve clarity or strengthen the document's intent?
    - **Compassion:** How might this change be perceived by different groups? Is the language inclusive?
    - **Honor:** Does this change build upon the existing work respectfully?
3. **Leave Constructive Comments:** Even a simple comment like, "I've read this and I support it," is incredibly valuable. Questions are also powerful: "Can you explain what you mean by this phrase?" or "Have you considered how this might affect Article VII?"

#### How a Change Is Approved: The Path to Consensus

A change is considered "approved" not by a single authority figure, but by the emergent consensus of the community.

- **Consensus over Command:** We will merge a Pull Request when there is a general sense of agreement from several community members and no strong, unresolved objections.
- **Time as a Factor:** If a PR receives several approvals (`+1`s, positive comments) and has no substantive objections for a reasonable period (e.g., **7-14 days**), it will be considered community-approved. This prevents good ideas from languishing forever.
- **The Role of a "Merge Steward":** For now, a temporary steward (cc785793) will perform the technical act of merging **community-approved** changes. This role is purely administrative, not authoritarian.

### The Path to Stewardship

As this community grows, official maintainers (or "stewards") will be needed. These will not be appointed; they will be recognized. Individuals who consistently offer thoughtful contributions, provide constructive reviews for others, and embody the project's principles will be invited by community consensus to take on official maintainer roles.
